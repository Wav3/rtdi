# Real Time Dashboard for Icinga (RTDI)

It's a fork from [Dashing](http://github.com/Shopify/dashing).  


This is an awesome solution to display the most important serverstatus from [icinga](http://icinga.org) in one (or more) dashboards in realtime.  
You can access the dashboards via every browser.
We use this to display our most important serverstatus from icinga in our offices with Raspberry Pi's.

This is one of our Dashboards.
